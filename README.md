# Lung Cancer Detection System

## Project Description
This project detects lung cancer from CT scan images using deep learning techniques. 
The system processes medical images and predicts possible cancer presence.

## Features
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN-based lung cancer detection
- GUI interface for selecting images
- Result prediction display
- Model trained using medical image dataset

## Project Files
- Main.py – Main program to run the system
- Model.py – CNN model architecture
- Augmentation.py – Image preprocessing
- create.py – Dataset preparation
- cnn_weights1.hdf5 – Trained model weights
- requirements.txt – Required libraries
- run.bat – Run file for project
- result.png – Sample output result
- sample processed image.png – Processed sample
- select_image.png – Image selection screen
- start.png – Application start screen

## How to Run
1. Install Python and required libraries
2. Install packages using:
3. Run the program:
4. Select CT image and view prediction result.

## Sample Outputs
